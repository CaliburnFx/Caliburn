Caliburn 2.0 exists to support existing applications built with Caliburn 1.0 and 1.1 which wish to upgrade to the latest .NET frameworks and presentation tier idioms. Please consider switching to [Caliburn.Micro](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro) for new development. Also, you may wish to investigate upgrading your Caliburn 1.0/1.1 application to [Caliburn.Micro](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro) instead of Caliburn 2.0\. There are no further investment in new versions for Caliburn. All future development will be focused on [Caliburn.Micro](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro).

Silverlight Examples

This solution contains various simple examples displaying the major features found in the Silverlight version of Caliburn.
There are slight differences between this and the WPF API.  I have tried to make note of that throughout the examples.
I have preceded all my comments with "Note:" in order to make it easy to discover the relevent pieces of a given feature's usage.

The assemblies needed for the features demonstrated in this solution are:
Caliburn.Core
Caliburn.PresentationFramework

Please take note of the App.xaml.cs file for each example in order to insure that you understand how to configure the framework for use with that particular feature.

I hope this helps you in your Silverlight endeavors!
